## Files in this directory

### `sample_run_output.md`

Shows what the harness produces when you run it.

**Use this when:**

- You want to see what "done" looks like
- You're debugging test output
- You're writing documentation that references results

### `truthfulness_example.md`

Deep dive on test case **TRU-002**: catching citation fabrication.

**Use this when:**

- You want to understand how constraint detection works
- You're designing tests for hallucination patterns
- You need to explain why fabrication matters

### `adding_custom_test.md`

Step-by-step guide for extending the harness with your own test cases.

**Use this when:**

- You've found a new failure mode
- You need to add constraints for a specific risk
- You're building a custom eval suite on top of this harness

## Philosophy

These examples are for practitioners, not beginners. They assume you:

- Know why calibration matters
- Understand metamorphic testing
- Care about adversarial pressure patterns
